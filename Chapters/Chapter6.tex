\section{Conclusions}
We conclude with the present work that TEP problems are suitable for a quantum annealer by providing a formulation for a small network with some simplifications. We test this formulation with D-Wave solvers and it outputs the expected result.\\\\
Lastly, due to the size of TEP problems, the current maturity of quantum computers and the fact that some variables of TEP problems are real, we proposed an hybrid quantum-classical approach based on an iterative method, Benders' decomposition. This open new possibilities to explore TEP problems by combining classical solvers -- that tackle the real and integer parts -- and quantum solvers -- that solve the binary problem -- taking advantage of the key features of each solver.
\section{Future Work}
This work presents an iterative approach to solve TEP problems but the data we have used is synthetic. There are different sources of energy raw data but depending on the source we have to load the data in different ways. Hopefully, the PyPSA python package\,\cite{PyPSA-Eur:PyPSA-Eur} does the work for us.\\\\
Dealing with real data implies not only dealing with real numbers -- that can be rounded to integers -- but also with a large number of variables which increase the complexity of the problem. These points are not hard to implement to the current approach but if we plan to add new targets such as storages -- which implies taking into account a time-dependence -- the linear equations that describe our problem are going to change. PyPSA can export the linear model for any number of targets considered in the problem and a plot of the associated network for a given number of nodes $N$, Figure\,\ref{fig:GeneralNetworks}. We should be able to read these linear equations and include it into our Benders' decomposition scheme. For this taks we plan to use QUARK\,\cite{dlrsc2023quark}, a reformulation kernel that allows us to send the algorithm to different quantum machines.

Lastly, we could compare our hybrid quantum-classical algorithm with the ones provided by the quantum solvers. We think that an specific hyrbrid quantum-classical approach should provide a better solution in term of computational time and optimal value, than the general hybrid solvers from D-Wave. Furthermore, we should be able to determine how much quantum solver are we employing in the problem, which do not happen with solvers such as D-Wave where it is not possible to know how much quantum solver we employed in the hybrid approach.
