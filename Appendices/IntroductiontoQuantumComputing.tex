\chapter{Introduction to Quantum Computing} % Main appendix title
This appendix serve as a quick introduction to quantum computing. We explain the basics concepts without going deeply in their physical meaning or historical approach. If you already know the basics of quantum computing you can skip this section. Additionally, for a reader interested in getting a deeper understanding of the topics, see \cite{W.Bryon1992HilbertFunctions} (for Hilbert Spaces) and \cite{Nielsen2010QuantumInformation} (for quantum computing).\\

\section{Hilbert Space}
Here, we begin defining the vector space where quantum computing takes place, the Hilbert space, $\mathcal{H}$.
\begin{definition}[Hilbert Space]
A Hilbert space is a special type of linear vector space whose elements are complex-valued \textit{square integrable}\footnote{A function $\psi(x)$ is said to be \textit{square integrable} on a given interval $\left[a, b\right]$ if $\int_{a}^{b}\|\psi(x)\|^{2}dx$ exist with a finite value.} functions, $\psi(x)$, of a real variable $x$, defined on the closed interval $\left[a, b\right]$, equipped with a \textit{complete inner product}, $(\cdot,\cdot)$, in $\mathbb{C}^{n}$.
\end{definition}
\begin{definition}[Inner Product]
Given two functions of the Hilbert space, $\psi_{1}$ and $\psi_{2}$, the inner product is defined by
\begin{equation}
    \left(\psi_{1}, \psi_{2}\right) \equiv \int^{b}_{a} \psi_{1}^{*}(x)\psi_{2}(x)dx
\end{equation}
so that given \{$\psi_{1}$,$\psi_{2}$,$\psi_{3}$\} $\in \mathbb{C}^{n}$ and \{$\alpha, \beta\} \in \mathbb{C}$, it satisfies:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Closed operation: $(\psi_{1},\psi_{2})\in \mathbb{C}^{n}$
    \item Conjugate symmetry: $(\psi_{1},\psi_{2}) = (\psi_{2},\psi_{1})^{*}$
    \item Linear with respect the second vector: $(\psi_{1},\lambda \cdot \psi_{2} + \beta\cdot\psi_{3}) = \lambda(\psi_{1},\psi_{2}) + \beta(\psi_{1},\psi_{3})$
    \item Anti-linear with respect the first vector: $(\lambda \cdot \psi_{1} + \beta \cdot \psi_{2}, \psi_{3}) = \lambda^{*}(\psi_{1},\psi_{3}) + \beta^{*} (\psi_{2},\psi_{3})$
    \item Positive definiteness: $(\psi, \psi) = \lVert \psi \rVert^{2} \in \left[0,\infty\right)$\footnote{The quantity $\lVert \psi \rVert^{2}$ is called the norm of $\psi$. If $\lVert \psi \rVert^{2}$ that does not imply $\psi(x) = 0$ for all $x$ in $\left[a,b\right]$. The function can have nonzero values at some points and the integral will remain zero. The integral roughly computes the area in a given interval, so, if there is just a point not null in the interval the area captured by a point is zero, so its contributions to the integral is zero.} 
    \item Distance: $d \equiv \left|\psi_{2} - \psi_{1}\right| = \sqrt{(\psi_{2}-\psi_{1},\psi_{2}-\psi_{1})}$
\end{itemize}
\end{definition}
\begin{definition}[Completeness of a space]
A complete space is one in which any Cauchy sequence of that space is convergent, i.e., tends towards a value inside the given space.
\end{definition}
\begin{definition}[Completeness of an orthonormal set of functions]
A set of orthonormal functions $\{\psi_{i}\}$ is complete if any function $\psi(x)$ in Hilbert space can be written as a linear combination of the $\psi_{i}(x)$\footnote{Here we do not ask for point convergence, we weaken the converge criterion to mean convergence. Otherwise, there would not exist a complete set of orthonormal function in the Hilbert space.}:
\begin{equation}
    \lim_{n\to \infty}\| \psi(x) - \sum_{i=1}^{n}c_{i}\psi_{i}(x)\|^{2}dx = 0
\end{equation}
\end{definition}
The following theorem states that the space of square-integrable functions, is complete.
\begin{theorem}[Riesz-Fischer]
Assume the functions $\psi_{1}(x),\psi_{2}(x),...$ are elements of Hilbert space. If
\begin{equation}
    \lim_{n,m\to\infty} \lVert \psi_{n} - \psi_{m}\rVert^{2} \equiv \lim_{n,m\to \infty} \int_{a}^{b} \|\psi_{n} - \psi_{m}\|^{2}dx = 0
\end{equation}
then there exist a square (Lebesgue) integrable function $\psi(x)$ to which the sequence $\psi_{n}(x)$ converges such that 
\begin{equation}
    \lim_{n\to \infty} \int_{a}^{b} \|\psi - \psi_{n}\|^{2}dx = 0
\end{equation}
Equivalently, let $\psi_{n}$ be a Cauchy sequence and $\psi$ a value inside the given space. Then, the Cauchy sequence converges to $\psi(x)$ \textit{in the mean}, i.e, we allow the difference $\|\psi(x) - \psi_{n}(x)\|^{2}\neq 0$ at some points $x$, so that the integral $\lim_{n\to \infty} \int_{a}^{b} \|\psi - \psi_{n}\|^{2}dx$ is zero when taking into account the whole interval.
\end{theorem}
\begin{definition}[Orthonormality]
A given set of functions $\{\psi_{i}\}$ is said to be orthonormal if
\begin{equation}
    \left(\psi_{i}, \psi_{j}\right) \equiv \int_{a}^{b} \psi_{i}^{*}(x)\psi_{j}(x) dx = \delta_{ij} 
\end{equation}
\end{definition}

In the present work we work with a particular Hilbert space, a finite Hilbert space. This implies or space is \textit{separable}.
\begin{definition}[Separable]
    A Hilbert space is said to be \textit{separable} if an only if it has an countable orthonormal basis.
\end{definition}
\begin{flushleft}
In a separable Hilbert space, it can be proved that there exist an orthonormal basis. So for a finite Hilbert space -- which is a countable space -- the orthogonal basis is guaranteed.
\end{flushleft}
\section{Notation}
Despite Hilbert spaces are the mathematical background of quantum physics, one can do quantum computing without knowing what a Hilbert space is.\\
The most common notation for quantum computing -- also for quantum mechanics -- is the Bra-Ket notation.
\begin{definition}[Dirac's Bra-Ket Notation]
(Add Dual space definition)
\end{definition}
\begin{flushleft}
Quantum computing calculations do not require to know all the fine details of the dual space. It is enough knowing the matrix form of a Bra -- row vector -- and a ket ......
\end{flushleft}
\section{Quantum bits}
A \textit{bit} is the smallest unit of information of classical computing. Analogously, a \textit{qubit} is the smallest unit of information for quantum computing. The following section treats bits and qubits as abstract mathematical objects without their physical implementation. In further sections, we describe some implementations of a physical qubit.\\
A classical bit has two possibles states usually named $\ket{0}$ or $\ket{1}$\footnote{The name of the states of a bit or qubit is not important. It is just a way of labelling those states.}. However, a quantum bit is a linear combination of states -- \textit{superposition} -- $\{\ket{0}, \ket{1}\}$. The general state of a qubit can be conceived as a vector in a two-dimensional complex vector space, with $\alpha, \beta \in \mathbb{C}$:
\begin{equation}
    \ket{\psi} = \alpha \ket{0} + \beta \ket{1} = \alpha \begin{bmatrix}
           1 \\
           0 
         \end{bmatrix}
         +
         \beta
         \begin{bmatrix}
           0 \\
           1 
         \end{bmatrix}
\end{equation}
where $\|\alpha\|^{2} + \|\beta\|^{2}$ = 1, i.e, the state of a qubit is normalized..
The last expression can be written in term of two parameters,
\begin{equation}
    \ket{\psi} = \cos{\frac{\theta}{2}}\ket{0} + e^{i\phi}\sin{\frac{\theta}{2}}\ket{1}
\end{equation}
that represent the angles of the Bloch Sphere \footnote{A Bloch sphere is a geometric representation of the state of a single qubit where each axis contain two orthogonal states, e.g., the Z-axis has the orthogonal states $\{\ket{0},\ket{1}\}$.}.\\
The states $\ket{0}$ and $\ket{1}$ form a computational basis states (orthonormal basis) for the $\mathbb{C}^{2}$ vector space. There are infinite single-qubit basis sets for $\mathbb{C}^{2}$, albeit the ones known as \textit{computational basis} are the ones that build the axis of the Bloch Sphere.

\end{figure}
\begin{align*}
    \Biggl\{\begin{bmatrix}
           0 \\
           1 
         \end{bmatrix}, \begin{bmatrix}
           1 \\
           0 
         \end{bmatrix} \Biggr\}\equiv \{\ket{0}, \ket{1}\} \in Z_{basis} \\
         \Biggl\{\begin{bmatrix}
           \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \\
           \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} 
         \end{bmatrix}, \begin{bmatrix}
           \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \\
           -\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} 
         \end{bmatrix} \Biggr\}\equiv \{\ket{+}, \ket{-}\} \in X_{basis} \\
         \Biggl\{\begin{bmatrix}
           \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \\
           \frac{i}{\sqrt{2}} 
         \end{bmatrix}, \begin{bmatrix}
           \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \\
           -\frac{i}{\sqrt{2}} 
         \end{bmatrix} \Biggr\}\equiv \{\ket{R}, \ket{L}\} \in Y_{basis}
\end{align*}
In general, we deal with multiple qubits. The basis for a n-qubit system is just the tensor product of n-single-qubit basis.\\
Suppose we have two qubits. Then, the $Z\otimes Z-basis$ is $\{\ket{00},\ket{01},\ket{10},\ket{11}\}$ and the state of a two-qubit system is described by the linear combination,
\begin{equation}
    \ket{\psi} = \alpha_{00}\ket{00} +\alpha_{01}\ket{01} +\alpha_{10}\ket{10} +\alpha_{11}\ket{11}
\end{equation}
where $\|\alpha_{00}\|^{2} + \|\alpha_{01}\|^{2} + \|\alpha_{10}\|^{2} + \|\alpha_{11}\|^{2} = 1$, i.e., the state is normalized.\\
The normalization condition for a n-qubit system can be written by
\begin{equation}
\boxed{\sum_{x\in \{0,1\}^{n}}\|\alpha_{x}\|^{2} = 1}
\end{equation}
\subsection{Measurements}
We can measure a classical bit to check if it is in the state 0 or 1. However, when we measure -- in the Z-basis -- a quantum bit we do not get the parameters $\alpha, \beta$ that describe the qubit state. Instead, we get either $\ket{0}$ or $\ket{1}$ with probabilities $\| \alpha\|^{2}$ and $\| \beta\|^{2}$ respectively.\\\\
In a measurement, the general state of the qubit collapse to one of the states of the basis we are using to measure. After this measurement the state of our qubit is fixed and successive measurements will give the same state with $100\%$ probability, i.e., measurements collapse a qubit into one of the basis states destroying superposition.
\blockquote{\textit{This dichotomy between the unobservable state of a qubit and the observations we can make lies at the heart of quantum computation and quantum information.}\\
\cite{Nielsen2010QuantumInformation}}
Suppose we have the following two-qubit state, called \textit{Bell state}\footnote{This state is the main ingredient in quantum teleportation.}
\begin{equation}
    \ket{\psi} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\left(\ket{00} + \ket{11}\right)
\end{equation}
If we measure the first qubit in the Z-basis, we can get either the state $\ket{0}$ or $\ket{1}$. We can see that both qubit are entanglement in the sense that knowing the state of the first qubit allow us to determine the state of the second qubit. In this case, if the first qubit measurement is $\ket{0}$ we know that the second qubit must be at state $\ket{0}$.\footnote{This was the \textit{spooky action at a distance} that bothers Einstein.} \\

\section{Schrödinger Equation}
The Schrödinger Equation cannot be derived, it just can be arrived and tested experimentally. The mathematical expression is
\begin{equation}
    \boxed{\hat{\mathcal{H}}\ket{\psi} = i\hbar \frac{\partial}{\partial t}\ket{\psi}}
\end{equation}
The Schrödinger equation governs the state and evolution of a system. It is the analogous of Newtonian equation in classical mechanics. \\
The operator $\hat{\mathcal{H}}$ is called the Hamiltonian of the system. 
\section{Speed-up advantage}
We end up the introduction to quantum computing by discussing the main features of quantum behavior that speed-up the algorithms versus its classical approach.\\
