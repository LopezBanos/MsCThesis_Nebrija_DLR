\chapter{Introduction to Oceans} % Main appendix title

This appendix justifies the name of the quantum approach we use in the present work -- \textit{Quantum Anneling} (QA) -- to solve \textit{Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization} (QUBO) problems. In the next sections, we show that the expressions we get in the classical approach known as \textit{Simulated Annealing} (SA), have the same functional form as the ones we get with QA \cite{Kadowaki1998QuantumModel}. To do that we are going to develop the solution for a stochastic problem. For a better understanding about stochastic problems see \cite{Schneider2006StochasticOptimization}.
